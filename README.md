This project tries to achieve the same as this [repo](https://github.com/ricardotik/react-comments)

This project was created by `created-react-app` with typescript version.
This project uses `typescript`, `redux` to make a comment box with a list of comments. Automated tests are included.
This project supposedly demo how to set up redux store and write automated tests in TypeScript with `enzyme`. Specifiically, this project will give a demo how to write prope test on `input` field and event handling like `click` and `change`. You may find `// README:` or `// TODO:` for more elaboration.

However there is some problem with the JSX in typescript.
